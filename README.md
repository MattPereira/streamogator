# Streamogator

Data analytics for all Buidl Guidl stream contracts deployed on Ethereum and Optimism

### Why?

To give stream contract admins and stream withdrawers more info about the novel capital allocation mechanism that is on chain streams. My hope is this build may inspire conversations and ideas that lead to better outcomes for everyone.

### Getting Started

1. Start the ponder backend framework

```
yarn ponder:dev
```

2. Start the frontend

```
yarn start
```

### Other Ideas

- Show amount of ETH in each contract
- Rank withdrawals by gas cost and total gas spent for each builder
- Click on a row to get the full details for transaction or builder in a modal pop up
