# Streamogator

Data analytics for all Buidl Guidl stream contracts deployed on Ethereum and Optimism

### Motivation

To provide the community with more information about this novel capital allocation mechanism. My hope is this build may inspire conversations and ideas that lead to better outcomes for all parties involved.

### Getting Started

1. Start the ponder backend framework

```
yarn ponder:dev
```

2. Start the frontend

```
yarn start
```

### Roadmap Ideas

- Click on a table row to see full details for transaction or builder in a modal pop up or details page
- Sort withdrawals by gas used
- Sort builders by total gas spent
- Show amount of ETH in each contract
